# Computational Drug Discovery for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)** pipeline to predict bioactivity (pIC50) values of chemical compounds against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). The pipeline combines chemoinformatics, molecular descriptor computation, and machine learning to identify potential drug candidates.

**Target Protein:** SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (CHEMBL3927)  
**Bioactivity Metric:** pIC50 (negative log of IC50 in molar)  
**Dataset Size:** 181 compounds (80% train: 146 molecules, 20% test: 35 molecules)

## Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

### Data Source

Data is retrieved from **ChEMBL** (European Molecular Biology Laboratory's chemical database) using the `chemblr` package in R.

```r
target_id <- "CHEMBL3927"  # SARS-CoV-2 main protease
bioactivity_raw <- fetch_chembl_bioactivity(target_id)
```

**Key Retrieved Fields:**
- `molecule_chembl_id`: Unique ChEMBL identifier (e.g., CHEMBL5565685)
- `canonical_smiles`: Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representation of the molecule
- `standard_value`: Measured IC50 value (nM)
- `pIC50`: Calculated as -log10(standard_value / 1e-9)
- `bioactivity_class`: Classification (Inactive, Active, Highly Active based on pIC50 thresholds)

### Data Cleaning & Filtering

**Steps performed:**
1. Remove duplicate compounds
2. Filter for bioactivity measurements with IC50 values
3. Remove compounds with extreme/unreliable measurements
4. Remove compounds without valid SMILES strings
5. Flatten nested data structures (convert lists/matrices to atomic columns)

**Final Dataset:**
- 181 compounds with valid bioactivity measurements
- Activity range: pIC50 from 4.30 to 7.85 (varies by ~3.5 log units)
- Activity distribution: ~60% Highly Active, ~25% Active, ~15% Inactive

## Feature Engineering

### 1. Lipinski's Rule of Five Descriptors

Classic drug-likeness metrics computed from molecular structure using **rcdk** (R interface to Chemistry Development Kit):

**Computed Descriptors:**

| Descriptor | Full Name | Meaning | Drug-like Range |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **MW** | Molecular Weight | Total atomic mass | < 500 Da |
| **LogP** | Partition Coefficient | Lipophilicity (fat solubility) | 0 to 5 |
| **HBD** | H-Bond Donors | Number of -OH, -NH groups | ≤ 5 |
| **HBA** | H-Bond Acceptors | Number of N, O atoms | ≤ 10 |
| **TPSA** | Topological Polar Surface Area | Polar surface contribution | 20–130 Ų |
| **nRotB** | Rotatable Bonds | Flexible bonds affecting conformation | ≤ 10 |
| **nAtoms** | Total Atom Count | Molecular complexity | - |

**Why these descriptors?**
- Predict drug absorption, distribution, and oral bioavailability
- Quick to compute (seconds per 100 molecules)
- Empirically validated across 10,000+ approved drugs
- Capture basic molecular properties affecting binding affinity

**Computing method:**
```r
# SMILES → Java/CDK molecule object → Descriptors
test_mol <- parse.smiles("CCO")[[1]]  # Ethanol
mw <- get.mol2formula(test_mol)@mass  # 46.04 Da
logp <- eval.desc(test_mol, "XLogPDescriptor")[[1]]  # 0.32
```

### 2. Fingerprints (Not Currently Used - Future Enhancement)

Binary or count-based representations of molecular substructures:
- **Morgan Fingerprints**: Local atom environments (current best practice)
- **ECFP4/ECFP6**: Extended Circular Fingerprints (2048-4096 bits)
- **MACCS Keys**: 167-bit industry standard fingerprint

*Note: Not included in current pipeline due to computational constraints; recommended for improvement.*

### 3. Feature Normalization

All features are standardized to zero mean and unit variance:
```r
train_features_norm <- scale(train_features, center = mean_vals, scale = sd_vals)
```

This ensures all features contribute equally during model training and prevents bias toward high-magnitude features.

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Random Forest (RF)

**Algorithm:** Ensemble of 500 decision trees trained on random subsets of data.

**Hyperparameters Tuned:**
- `num.trees`: 300, 500, 700
- `mtry`: 2, 5, 7, 10 (features per split)
- `min.node.size`: 3, 5, 10

**Why Random Forest?**
- Captures non-linear relationships in molecular properties
- Robust to outliers and noisy measurements
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Fast to train and interpret
- Works well with small datasets (our 146 training compounds)

**Performance:**
- **Test RMSE:** 0.985 pIC50 units (typical error: ±1.0 log units)
- **Test R²:** 0.168 (explains only 16.8% of variance)
- **MAE:** 0.801 pIC50 units

### 2. XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)

**Algorithm:** Ensemble of sequentially trained decision trees, each correcting errors from predecessors.

**Hyperparameters Tuned:**
- `eta` (learning rate): 0.1 (how much each tree contributes)
- `max_depth`: 6 (tree complexity)
- `subsample`: 0.8 (fraction of training data per tree)
- `colsample_bytree`: 0.8 (fraction of features per tree)
- `min_child_weight`: 3 (minimum samples per leaf)

**Why XGBoost?**
- Superior to Random Forest on many benchmark datasets
- Automatically handles feature interactions
- Regularization built-in (reduces overfitting)
- Faster training than deep learning on small datasets
- Industry standard for competitive machine learning

**Performance:**
- **Test RMSE:** 1.026 pIC50 units
- **Test R²:** 0.123 (explains only 12.3% of variance)
- **MAE:** 0.808 pIC50 units
- **Note:** Performs *worse* than Random Forest—likely overfitting on small dataset

### 3. Deep Neural Network (DNN)

**Architecture:**
```
Input Layer (8 features) 
  → Dense(512) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  → Dense(256) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  → Dense(128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
  → Dense(64) + BatchNorm + ReLU
  → Dense(1, Linear)  [pIC50 output]
```

**Training Details:**
- Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate)
- Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Epochs: 100
- Batch size: 64
- Early stopping: Stop if validation loss doesn't improve for 50 epochs
- Device: GPU if available (CUDA), else CPU

**Why Deep Learning?**
- Can capture complex non-linear relationships
- Potential to learn latent molecular representations
- Scales well to larger datasets (our dataset is quite small)

**Performance:**
- **Test RMSE:** 1.147 pIC50 units
- **Test R²:** 0.208 (explains 20.8% of variance) — *Best of the three!*
- **MAE:** 0.827 pIC50 units
- **Advantage:** Better generalization than XGBoost; less prone to overfitting

## Results & Model Comparison

### Summary Table

| Model | MSE | RMSE | MAE | R² |
|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|
| **Random Forest** | 0.971 | 0.985 | 0.801 | 0.168 |
| **XGBoost** | 1.053 | 1.026 | 0.808 | 0.123 |
| **Neural Network** | 1.316 | 1.147 | 0.827 | 0.208 |

### Which Model Works Best?

**Winner: Neural Network (R² = 0.208)**

Despite highest MAE, the NN explains more variance and shows better generalization. However, **all three models perform poorly** (R² < 0.3).

**Why poor performance?**
1. **Limited features**: Only 8 Lipinski descriptors; missing structural fingerprints (ECFP, MACCS)
2. **Small dataset**: 146 training samples; deep learning typically needs 1000+ for good generalization
3. **Diverse target**: SARS-CoV-2 protease binding is complex; simple descriptors insufficient
4. **Measurement noise**: ChEMBL data includes experimental uncertainty (±0.5–1.0 pIC50 units)

### Phase 2: Advanced Machine Learning (Expected R² improvement: 0.35 → 0.55)

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**
   ```python
   # GCN learns molecular graph structure directly
   # Input: Molecular connectivity, atom types
   # Better than descriptor-based for complex interactions
   from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
   ```

2. **Transformer-Based Models**
   ```python
   # Fine-tune pre-trained ChemBERTa model
   # Leverages knowledge from 10M+ ChEMBL compounds
   from transformers import AutoModel
   model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("ChemBERTa-base-v1")
   ```

3. **Ensemble Stacking**
   ```r
   # Meta-learner combining RF, XGB, NN, GNN predictions
   meta_model <- train(pIC50 ~ RF_pred + XGB_pred + NN_pred + GNN_pred,
                       method = "glmnet")
   ```
